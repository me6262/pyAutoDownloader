# pyAutoDownloader


this is an app made by me, probably only
for me as well

it serves as a possible replacement for the 
existing autonomousDownloader application 
for frc team 238

the original application was made in c# with
.NET framework 6, i wanted to be able to
make changes to it easily while also remaining
on linux, so while I was bored, I started to
completely rebuild the app in python using 
GTK3 python binds. which theoretically should
function on windows and mac as well as linux.

this allows future students with different 
hardware and software preferences not be 
excluded in what they are allowed to use as
development tools for the team.

presently, the only other applications that
would not be availible on other platforms
that cannot be adapted elsewhere are the
various tuning applications for motor controllers
and the like. however, those can be likely
run in WINE. also, we would likely only use
these tools near the start of a season on one
of the team software laptops anyway. so not 
much of a loss really



FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------------------------
this will likely for now simply clone the
capabilities of the existing autonomousDownloader
there may be a few standout improvements in 
the future, such as the ability to drag anf
drop commands into the builder section

currently, it only serves as a viewer for autos
but progress is moving very fast and will be
here soon


INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------

coming soon
